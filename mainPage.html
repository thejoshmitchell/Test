    <p>A crash course in pitching your ideas to investors and early customers</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><em>Introduction to Pitching</em></h2>
    <p>The journey of the entrepreneur is a unique, exciting and challenging experience.
      It is a very unique path that attracts different people for different reasons and will look very different depending on the person.
      However, every aspiring entrepreneur will begin their career with a particular concept or venture that they are enthusiastic about.
      Much of the success of his or her venture will be determined by the quality and content of their initial pitch. This crash course provides the necessary
    steps and information necessary to ensure your pitch is one that will take your startup to the next level.</p>

        <h2><em>Core Components</em></h2>
        <p>
        As Ryan Robinson, a content marketing consultant to the world's top experts and emerging startups outlines, a good pitch accomplished four
        main criteria:<br>
        "A good pitch balances business and emotional needs.
        Whether you're pitching to a company, an investor, a customer, or a potential partner, you have to hit a person on both emotional and business levels.
        Without this, your pitch is almost certain to fall flat."<br>
        "A good pitch is succinct. In most cases, you only have a few seconds to capture someone's attention and get your point across.
        Focus and momentum are your friends."<br>
        "A good pitch tells a story. Humans have been telling tales for thousands of years.
        Which is why it's a great idea for the flow of your pitch, whether verbal or in a slide deck, to follow a narrative pattern."<br>
        "A good pitch focuses on benefits. Value beats price every single time.
        Rather than focus on cost or features, your pitch needs to focus on the value you're going to create for the person you're pitching."<br>
        <br>
        How would we go about accomplishing each of these different aspects of a successful pitch?
          </p>
        <h3>1.Do your homework:</h3>
        <p>
            Industry research: <br> What is the need that inspired your concept to begin with? What other options exist on the market?<br>
            <br>
            Consumer research: <br> What is your specific painpoint that you are addressing? What audience is this most relevant to?<br>
        </p>
        <h3>2.Build a connection</h3>
        <p>Create some type of bond with your audience. Consumers are more likely to buy from people they feel they can relate to or causes that
        resonate with them on a personal level. There is a reason you often see athletes used as marketers for different sports equipment. Consumers
        involved in athletic activity want a level credibility associated with the products they buy. This same concept can be applied to every sector
        of commercial consumption.<br>
        <br>
        How do you relate to your audience? <br>
        What experiences give you credibility in your chosen entrepreneurial venture? <br>
        What proof do you have that this product will best meet the needs of the people you have created this product for? <br>
      </p>
        <h3>3.Find the proper middle ground of detail</h3>
        <p>It is important that you convery enough information so that people know what the purpose of your venture is. However, you also don't
        want to bore the audience with an excessive amount of specific information that is only truly relevant to you. A primary factor in deciding what
        the most important points to highlight are is your audience. The information you prioritize will be different if you're pitching to customers or
        to investors.
        </p>
        <h3>4.So What?</h3>
        <p>Through every step of your pitch presentation, one question should be front and center in your mind: "so what?" Why are the statements I'm making in this
        moment relevant to anyone in this room other than myself. In many ways, this concept ties back into the "building a connection" point, but I have decided
        to make it a separate point because this idea is so easily forgotten in the heat of the moment, especially by younger entrepreneurs</p>
        <h3>5.Practice</h3>
        <p>In order to pitch your venture in a truly effective and compelling fashion, the process must become second nature to you. This will only occur through
        constant repition and optimization in front of different audiences</p>
        <h3>6.Edit/Revise</h3>
        <p>As time progresses and you are able to learn more about your market and your audience, your pitch shoud evolve and improve
          Similar to our constitution, your venture pitch should be a "living and breathing document", retaining its core principles and concepts while
        constantly reshaping its application in order to best address the everchanging landscape of contemporary society. Five years into your venture,
      your pitch should not be identical the one you create in your first week as an entrepreneur. </p>

        <h2><em>Successful Examples</em></h2>
        <p>The following examples are the initial pitch decks of four very well known companies. Each of them started out as concepts and ideas put forth by a small group of
        aspiring entrepreneurs. Examine each of them and try to mentally connect aspects of these pitch decks to the core concepts we previously discussed.</p>

        <h2><em>Activity</em></h2>
        <form class="" action="mailto:jmitche2@ncsu" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
          <label>Think of your favorite past time activity. This can literally be any experience you would like to share. In the space below, describe
          the activity in as much detail as possible.</label><br>
          <textarea name="name" rows="8" cols="150"></textarea><br>
          <input type="submit" name="sendButton" value="submit">
        </form>
        <form class="" action="mailto:jmitche2@ncsu" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
          <label>Now that you have thought about and explained your favorite activity, take some time to identify the core aspects of what makes this activity so
          enjoyable for you. Try to avoid surface level statements like "it's fun" or "I like it." Dig a little deeper and try to figure out what makes this
          activity fun or likeable.</label><br>
          <textarea name="name" rows="8" cols="150"></textarea><br>
          <input type="submit" name="sendButton" value="submit">
        </form>
        <form class="" action="mailto:jmitche2@ncsu" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
          <label>Conduct a small amount of online research about the popularity of this activity in society at large. In what ways do most people partake in this
          activity, and how similar are these examples to your own experiences. Look into some of the primary companies that offer these types of experiences, and
          the price points at which they are offered. </label><br>
          <textarea name="name" rows="8" cols="150"></textarea><br>
          <input type="submit" name="sendButton" value="submit">
        </form>
        <form class="" action="mailto:jmitche2@ncsu" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
          <label>Now, in 100 words or less, try to convince me to partake in this activity. Draw upon both your experiences and the research you conducted. Try to be
          as quantitative as you can about what this activity will likely cost me, and then make the case why it is worth it for me to do it. Assume that I am a person with
        limited time and resources, and need strong arguments to convince me to partake in this experience. Again, do not exceed 100 words. </label><br>
